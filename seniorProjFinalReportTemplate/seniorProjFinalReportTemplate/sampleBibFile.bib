	abstract = {The Borg MOEA is a self-adaptive multiobjective evolutionary algorithm capable of solving complex, many-objective environmental systems problems efficiently and reliably. Water and environmental resources problems pose significant computational challenges due to their potential for large Pareto optimal sets, the presence of disjoint Pareto-optimal regions that arise from discrete choices, multi-modal suboptimal regions, and expensive objective function calculations. This work develops two large-scale parallel implementations of the Borg MOEA, the master–slave and multi-master Borg MOEA, and applies them to a highly challenging risk-based water supply portfolio planning problem. The performance and scalability of both implementations are compared on up to 16384 processors. The multi-master Borg MOEA is shown to scale efficiently on tens of thousands of cores while dramatically improving the reliability of attaining high-quality solutions. Our results dramatically expand the scale and scope of complex environmental systems that can be addressed using many-objective evolutionary optimization.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a many-objective hybrid real-code population-based incremental learning and differential evolution algorithm (MnRPBILDE) is proposed based on the concept of objective function space reduction. The method is then implemented on real engineering design problems. The topology, shape and sizing design of a simplified automotive floor-frame structure are formulated and used as test problems. A variety of well-established multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) including the original version of MnRPBILDE are employed to solve the test problems while the results are compared based on hypervolume and C indicators. The results indicate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the other MOEAs. The proposed algorithm is effective and efficient for many-objective optimisations of a car floor-frame structure.},
